# Editable React Table (React + CDN + LocalStorage)

This is a simple editable table built using **ReactJS** with CDN setup and Babel in the browser. It allows users to edit a list of user data and persist it in the browser using `localStorage`, so changes are not lost on page refresh.

## Features

- Editable fields: Name, Email, Role
- Data persists using `localStorage`
- Uses CDN for React and Babel (no Node.js or build tools required)
- Console log on "Submit Data" button (API integration-ready)
